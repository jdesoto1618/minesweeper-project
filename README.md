# Minesweeper Created With JavaScript

As of August 1st, the game is desktop-only. I'll update the project to include a mobile-friendly version.

Other updates are still upcoming, such as general styling improvements.

Also planning on adding text to the game to show number of remaining flags that can be placed, and a simple win/lose message. I might also add a button to restart the game and show a general counter for the number of clicks.
